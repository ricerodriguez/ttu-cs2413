     instantiate priority queue => pq
     set distance to each vertex to infinity
     set distance to S to 0
     push all vertices to pq
     while pq is not empty:
          pop pq into V
          for each vertex adjacent to V (called v1)
               new distance = distance from S to v + distance from v to v1
               if new distance < distance from S to v1:
                    distance from S to v1 = new distance
                    adjust v1 position in pq based on new distance
