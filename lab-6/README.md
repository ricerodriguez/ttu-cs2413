## Lab 6
Implement a graph using an edge list, adjacency matrix, or adjacency list
structure. The graph much contain an `add_edge()`, and `add_node()` function.
You may construct your graph in your main function. Once you have constructed
your graph you must implement a Breadth first search and execute the breadth on
your constructed graph. Display the nodes in the order that they are visited by
your breadth first search.
