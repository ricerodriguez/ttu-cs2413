## Lab Assignments for Data Structures
This is a personal repository of the lab assignments from CS 2413 (Data Structures) at Texas Tech. These lab assignments were given the summer of 2018 by Frank Conlon and were completed by Victoria Rodriguez. There is a folder for each lab assignment containing the header file, the class definition file, and the main file which uses these class definitions for each lab assignment. A README in each folder contains the assignment description/requirements.
