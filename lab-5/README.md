## Lab 5
Write a Binary Search Tree. Your program should be able to accept a list of
numbers from the command line and then build a binary search tree from them
using a series of inserts. Once the tree is built it should be able to searched
and traverse. You should also be able to remove a node from the tree. At a
minimum you must be able to traverse the tree with a pre, post, or in order
depth first traversal.
