## Lab 4
Turn your linked list into a Stack. At a minimum your Stack should have the
functions `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`, `empty()`, and `print()`. Be sure to have a
Stack.h, Stack.cpp and main.cpp file in your submission. This time write your
program so that it asks the user for input and calls the appropriate functions.
When pop is called the number that is popped should be displayed. Commands will
be formatted as follows on the command line:

`push num`  
`pop`  
`empty`  
`print`  
`peek`  

Turn your linked list into a Queue. At a minimum your Queue should have the
functions `push()`, `pop()`, and `peek()`, `empty()`, and `print()`. Be sure to have a
Stack.h, Stack.cpp and main.cpp file in your submission. This time write your
program so that it asks the user for input and calls the appropriate functions.
When pop is called the number that is popped should be displayed. Commands will
be formatted as follows on the command line

`push num`  
`pop`  
`empty`  
`print`  
`peek`
